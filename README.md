## Installation

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: pavel-theme THIS NEEDS TO BE REMOTE_THEME
```

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pavel-theme YES THIS




When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `pavel-theme.gemspec` accordingly.
